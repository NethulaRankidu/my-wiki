# Installing XDM
## Step 01
Open whatever browser you use. I'll use Firefox in this tutorial.

## Step 02
Once opened, go to address bar and paste https://xtremedownloadmanager.com/#downloads and press enter (or somehow go to this website)

## Step 03
I'm gonna use Version 7.2.11 for this installation (latest stable build) depending on your Operating System, your choice is different
- If you are a **windows user** - Click the hyperlink named ``MSI Installer``
- If you are a **Linux user** - Click the hyperlink named ``Linux Installer``

I'm using windows in this case, so, I'm clicking on ``MSI Installer``
## Step 04
Let your computer download it

Once downloaded, click on the file

## Step 05.1
If your browser shows something like this, Click OK

## Step 06
Wait a bit.. patience is the key ðŸ˜œ

## Step 07
If it asks for administration power, give it (obviously, it is asked by XDM, not powershell. I had to use this image as I can't screenshot it)

After this, XDM will open itself
